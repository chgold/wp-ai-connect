Connect AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude) to your WordPress site with simple, secure authentication.

== Description ==

**AI Connect** enables AI agents to interact with your WordPress content through secure JWT authentication using the WebMCP protocol.

Perfect for AI-powered customer support, automated content analysis, intelligent search, and custom AI integrations.

= ✨ Features =

* **WebMCP Protocol Support** - Industry-standard AI integration
* **Simple Authentication** - Direct username/password login, no complex OAuth setup
* **5 WordPress Tools** - Search/get posts, pages, and user info
* **Rate Limiting** - Prevent abuse (50 req/min default)
* **Security Controls** - Rotate JWT secret, block specific users
* **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box
* **Extensible** - Add custom tools via developer hooks

= 🎯 Quick Start for AI Users =

**Using ChatGPT or Claude?**

Tell your AI agent:
> "I want to connect you to my WordPress site at https://mysite.com using AI Connect plugin. The manifest is at /wp-json/ai-connect/v1/manifest"

The AI will ask for your WordPress username and password to authenticate.

= 🛠️ Available Tools =

1. **wordpress.searchPosts** - Search posts with filters
2. **wordpress.getPost** - Get single post by ID or slug
3. **wordpress.searchPages** - Search pages
4. **wordpress.getPage** - Get single page by ID or slug
5. **wordpress.getCurrentUser** - Get authenticated user info

= 🔒 How Authentication Works =

**Simple and Universal:**

Any AI agent can connect to your WordPress site using:
* WordPress username
* WordPress password

**The AI agent operates as the user who authenticated:**
* The agent receives a JWT token linked to that user's ID
* All API requests run with that user's permissions
* The agent respects WordPress user capabilities

**Examples:**

**If Administrator logs in:**
* ✅ Sees all posts (including drafts, private)
* ✅ Full access based on admin capabilities

**If Subscriber logs in:**
* ✅ Sees only published content
* ❌ Cannot see drafts or private content

**Note:** All API calls require authentication, even for reading public content. This prevents abuse and enables rate limiting.

= 🔐 Admin Controls =

**For Site Administrators:**

Go to **AI Connect → Settings** to manage security:

* **Rotate JWT Secret** - Emergency disconnect all AI agents (all tokens become invalid)
* **Block Users** - Revoke access for specific WordPress users
* **Rate Limits** - Configure request limits (default: 50/min, 1000/hour)

== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation =

1. Go to **Plugins → Add New** in WordPress admin
2. Search for "AI Connect"
3. Click **Install Now** and then **Activate**

= Manual Installation =

1. Download the plugin zip file
2. Go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**
3. Upload the zip file and click **Install Now**
4. Activate the plugin
5. Run `composer install` in the plugin directory to install dependencies

= Setup =

**No setup required!** The plugin works immediately after activation.

**Optional:** Configure rate limits in **AI Connect → Settings**

= Testing Your Setup =

**Quick cURL Test:**

```bash
# Step 1: Login and get access token
curl -X POST "http://yoursite.com/wp-json/ai-connect/v1/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"your_username","password":"your_password"}'

# You'll receive an access_token

# Step 2: Use the access token
curl -X POST "http://yoursite.com/wp-json/ai-connect/v1/tools/wordpress.getCurrentUser" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is WebMCP? =

WebMCP (Web Model Context Protocol) is a standardized protocol for connecting AI agents to web services. It defines how AI assistants discover, authenticate with, and execute tools on web platforms.

= Does this work with ChatGPT and Claude? =

Yes! AI Connect works with any AI platform that supports REST APIs. This includes ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Make.com, Zapier, and custom applications.

= Why does reading public content require authentication? =

All API calls require authentication for security:
* **Rate Limiting** - Prevents spam and abuse
* **Monitoring** - Track who uses your API
* **Security** - Protects against data scraping and DDoS attacks

This is the industry standard (Twitter, GitHub, Google APIs all require auth).

**Exception:** The manifest endpoint is public (no auth needed).

= How does the AI agent authentication work? =

**User authentication:** The AI agent operates as the WordPress user who authenticated.

When a user provides their credentials to an AI agent:
* The agent receives a JWT token linked to that user's ID
* All API requests run with that user's permissions
* The agent inherits the user's capabilities

**Security:** The agent is NOT a superuser - it respects WordPress user capabilities.

= Is Redis required? =

No, Redis is optional. The plugin works perfectly with WordPress transients. However, Redis is recommended for high-traffic sites (>1,000 requests/day) as it provides better rate limiting performance.

= Can I add custom tools? =

Yes! AI Connect is extensible. Use WordPress hooks to add custom tools:

```php
add_action('ai_connect_register_tools', function($manifest) {
    $manifest->register_tool('mysite.getStats', [...]);
});
```

[See full documentation →](https://github.com/chgold/ai-connect)

= How long do tokens last? =

* **Access Token**: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
* **Refresh Token**: 30 days (2,592,000 seconds)

Use the refresh token to get a new access token without re-authentication.

= Can I revoke access? =

Yes! Go to **AI Connect → Settings** and:

**For all users:**
* Click **"Rotate JWT Secret"** to invalidate all tokens immediately

**For specific user:**
* Enter user ID in "Block User" section
* User cannot authenticate or use existing tokens

= How do I troubleshoot authentication errors? =

**Common issues:**

* **"authentication_failed"** - Check username and password
* **"access_denied"** - User is blocked (check Settings)
* **"Token expired"** - Use refresh token to get new access token
* **"Rate limit exceeded"** - Wait for retry period or increase limits in Settings
* **REST API 404** - Flush permalinks (Settings → Permalinks → Save)

Enable WordPress debug mode and check `wp-content/debug.log` for details.

= Where can I get support? =

* **Bug Reports**: https://github.com/chgold/ai-connect/issues
* **Community**: WordPress.org support forums
